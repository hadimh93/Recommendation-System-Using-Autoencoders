Objectives
The main objectives of this recommendation system are to:

Increase the number of sales
Improve the company's revenue
Encourage engagement and activity on products and services
Gain a competitive advantage by providing better recommendations than competitors
Calibrate user preferences to understand their needs and interests
Make personalized recommendations that cater to each user's unique preferences
